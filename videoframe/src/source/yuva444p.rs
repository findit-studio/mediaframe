//! YUVA 4:4:4 planar (`AV_PIX_FMT_YUVA444P`) — 8 bit per sample.
//!
//! Storage mirrors [`super::Yuv444p`] (Y / U / V each full-resolution
//! `u8`) plus a fourth full-resolution alpha plane (1:1 with Y).
//!
//! Per-row dispatcher hands the alpha source straight through to the
//! `yuv_444_to_rgba_with_alpha_src_row` SIMD/scalar paths — same shape
//! as the 4:2:0 sibling [`super::Yuva420p`]. Per-arch SIMD coverage is
//! shipped together with the format wiring (Ship 8b‑6).
